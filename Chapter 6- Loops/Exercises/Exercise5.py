# Exercise 5: No Pastrami :ballot_box_with_check:

#Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure 
#the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add code

#near the beginning of your program to print a message saying
# the deli has run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all 

#occurrences of 'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. 
#Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up in finished_sandwiches.

#This is the solution of exercise

                   'Falafel','beef roasted','pastrami',]
