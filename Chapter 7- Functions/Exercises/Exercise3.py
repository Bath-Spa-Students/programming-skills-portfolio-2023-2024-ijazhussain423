# Exercise 3: T-Shirt ☑️
#Write a function called make_shirt() that accepts a size and the text of a 
#message that should be printed on the shirt. The function
#should print a sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the 
#message printed on it. Call the function once using positional
#arguments to make a shirt. Call the function a second time using keyword arguments.


def make_shirt(size, message):
    "Summarize the shirt that's going to be made."
    print(f"\nI'm going to make a {size} t-shirt.")
    print(f'It will say "{message}"')
make_shirt('small','Doremon!')
make_shirt(message="ijaz.",size='large')
